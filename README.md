# Random Chord Generator
A page for generating a random chord to help me learn chords and notes on the guitar neck

The basic concept here is to use JS to generate a random Note and chord type. 
The inspiration to do this is based on the chords lessons from [Scotty West's Absolutely Understand Guitar](https://youtu.be/Gg1L-sBIxnY?si=wiIQd68Dyt9Uye_F).

Currently, the Chord Generator will generate a chord from only common keys (no rare enharmonics)
and only chord voicings that I am personally familiar with. I will add in more as is necessary.
